## rubric
1) Complete the tutorials below. Submit your code, and a brief write up of your results.

Multi-Class Text Classification

2) Train an LSTM on the nursery rhymes below and use it to create a new nursery rhyme. The new nursery rhyme should consist of 30 lines, each of which is comprised of 20 words.
As there is no specific quantitative metric to assess here, this portion of the writeup's analysis of results will consist of a human interpretation of the performance of the model's nursery rhyme generation.

Please submit your code, a README, and the writeup. Given the multiple experiments within this assignment, your report will likely need to be ~4 pages
